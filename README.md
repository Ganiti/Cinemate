Cinemate is a Content- based movie recommendation webapp built using Cosine similarity which provides movie recommendations similar to the user's preferences .
 
## Content based Filtering and Cosine Similarity
Content Based Filtering- They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.



Cosine similarity- It is a metric used to determine how similar documents are regardless of their size. It estimates the cosine of the angle formed by two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space mathematically. Because of the cosine similarity, even if two comparable documents are separated by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the documents), they are likely to be orientated closer together. The larger the cosine similarity, the smaller the angle.
